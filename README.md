# K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project involves using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify data points into different categories based on their features. The goal is to build a simple yet effective classification model that leverages the proximity of data points to make predictions, making it ideal for tasks where decision boundaries are not linear.

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset includes various features that can be used to classify data points into distinct classes.
- **Classes:** The dataset consists of multiple classes, each representing a different category.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Data Handling:**
  - `Pandas` for loading, processing, and analyzing the dataset.
- **Model Development:**
  - `Scikit-learn` for implementing the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- **Data Visualization:**
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualizing data distributions and decision boundaries.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:

- **Data Normalization:**
  - Scaled the features using `MinMaxScaler` to ensure that all data points are within a similar range, which is crucial for KNN.
  
- **Train-Test Split:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

### Model Development:

- **KNN Algorithm:**
  - Implemented the KNN algorithm using Scikit-learn, selecting an optimal value for `k` through cross-validation.
  
- **Distance Metrics:**
  - Experimented with different distance metrics like Euclidean and Manhattan to determine the best fit for the dataset.
  
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

  knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
  knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
  predictions = knn.predict(X_test)
  ```

### Model Evaluation:

- **Accuracy:**
  - Evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test set to gauge its classification performance.
  
- **Confusion Matrix:**
  - Used a confusion matrix to visualize the model's classification accuracy across different classes.

## Results

The KNN model provided accurate classifications for the test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm for the given dataset. The choice of `k` and the distance metric played significant roles in the model's performance.

## Conclusion

This project illustrates the application of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks. The model's simplicity and effectiveness make it a good choice for problems where the decision boundary is not well-defined.

## Future Work

- Explore different feature selection techniques to enhance model performance.
- Experiment with different values of `k` and distance metrics to further optimize the model.
- Apply the KNN model to more complex datasets with a higher number of features and classes.
